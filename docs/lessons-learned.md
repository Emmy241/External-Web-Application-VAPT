# Lessons Learned

## Strong Defaults Matter
Keeping core components up to date and minimizing third-party dependencies significantly reduces real-world risk.

## Exposure Is Not Exploitation
Not every exposed feature is exploitable. Accurate security assessment requires understanding how attackers realistically chain behaviors.

## Manual Validation Is Essential
Automated tools surface signals, but human validation is critical to:
- Eliminate false positives
- Correctly rate risk
- Avoid overstating impact

## Reporting Is a Security Skill
Clear, honest reporting builds more trust than exaggerated findings. Security value comes from prioritization, not volume.

## Defense-in-Depth Wins
Layered controls — configuration hardening, endpoint restriction, and browser protections — meaningfully improve resilience over time.
