# Remediation Guidance

## Priority Recommendations

1. Restrict or disable XML-RPC if not required
2. Prevent user enumeration via public endpoints
3. Update WordPress themes promptly
4. Implement recommended HTTP security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

These actions represent **low-cost, high-impact** improvements that significantly reduce attack surface.

A follow-up assessment is recommended after remediation to validate fixes.
